As the user scrolls, the information details come into view and a line between the items animates. When we inspect this animation, we can see that the line is a pseudo-element that scales on the X-axis (from 0 to 1) when the section comes into the viewport:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre><code>.c-list_item.is-inview::before, \n.c-list_item.is-inview:last-child::after {\ntransform: scale(1);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The “is-inview” class gets added to each list item when it enters the viewport. A clever technique to animate a pseudo element! Certainly a nice detail ????</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><h4>Video Vault</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj0Qx8HpNUo&amp;t\"><img width=\"660\" style=\"border:0;width:660px;height:auto;\" alt=\"True Parallax\" src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/10ffec652b0f54fe5d8682ac0/images/385a91d3-14c8-af4c-a7f3-27a8e377a2e5.jpeg\" /></a>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj0Qx8HpNUo&amp;t\">True parallax with CSS-only is now possible</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin Powell shows how thanks to <em>scroll-timeline: scroll()</em>, we can now create true parallax effects without JavaScript and have complete control over the speed of each layer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><h4>Demo Corner</h4>\n\n\n\n<p></p><h4>From our blog</h4>\n\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.5;\">And that’s it!

But the vast majority of “AI art” I’ve seen is not that. It’s theft. You don’t have a right to “free” art, in the same way you don’t have a right to have your car fixed for free.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I saw someone post the other day about how good AI-generated imagery is now, and how they’d paid good money for comparable illustrations for a print magazine back in the day. The implication I heard (perhaps not intended) was that they could have swapped in AI graphics, if they’d been this quality then. It made me sad that someone you’d think would value creative works would be just as happy to have a computer “do it for free.” That editorial illustration is seen as a cost, not a contributor of value. (I feel the same way about <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/21/the-dream-of-ai-is-the-dream-of-free-labor/\">corporations viewing employees as costs instead of assets</a>.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just like LLMs, AI image generators are trained on image data scraped from the internet, much of it copyrighted, and almost all of it without the artists’ permission. Artists train for years, sometimes decades, to hone their craft in a precarious and low-paid industry. Without their skill, which produces the training data, these models simply wouldn’t be possible.

        "text": "Liked Stop Using AI-Generated Images by Michelle Barker (CSS { In Real Life })AI can be used by artists to augment their work and explore an exciting, new, creative frontier. But the vast majority of “AI art” I’ve seen is not that. It’s theft. You don’t have a right to “free” art, in the same way you don’t have a right to have your car fixed for free.\nI saw someone post the other day about how good AI-generated imagery is now, and how they’d paid good money for comparable illustrations for a print magazine back in the day. The implication I heard (perhaps not intended) was that they could have swapped in AI graphics, if they’d been this quality then. It made me sad that someone you’d think would value creative works would be just as happy to have a computer “do it for free.” That editorial illustration is seen as a cost, not a contributor of value. (I feel the same way about corporations viewing employees as costs instead of assets.)\nJust like LLMs, AI image generators are trained on image data scraped from the internet, much of it copyrighted, and almost all of it without the artists’ permission. Artists train for years, sometimes decades, to hone their craft in a precarious and low-paid industry. Without their skill, which produces the training data, these models simply wouldn’t be possible. And yet the artists are not compensated or credited in any way.\nI get that paying for illustration is expensive for a small publication, but that’s part of the deal: you have to pay for creative work, otherwise you’re undermining its value. (In the past, I donated editorial illustrations to a friend’s literary magazine, but I wouldn’t do it again today.)

(While I’m subtweeting, I just flipped open an article I thought might be relevant — about work and automation — and its editorial graphic was AI-generated ????‍♀️)\nArtists and writers must have solidarity across creative industries: if you wouldn’t feel comfortable with your own work being replaced by algogen, then you shouldn’t use generated content of other creative mediums. Even if you would never pay for illustration anyway, the choice to use generated imagery on your blog or publication normalizes the valuelessness of human-created art — go back to using free stock photography if you must have a graphic, or… just skip the graphic altogether.

She initially called the toggle “fake” and said it did “absolutely nothing”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It simply gives the user the impression that they (and the website owners) are considering the planet, without actually changing anything,” she wrote. “A classic example of greenwashing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Barker said a low carbon site “should be the default” instead of giving users the option to switch to one, and said the language used by the COP28 website was problematic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The toggle label when low carbon mode is toggled on, ‘Switch back to full experience,’ makes it sound like users are missing out on something by switching on low carbon mode, when in fact (if done right) they could be gaining a better, faster experience,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fershad Irani is a freelance web sustainability consultant in Taiwan who is part of the Green Web Foundation. He said he was excited when he first saw COP28’s low-carbon toggle, but was disappointed by its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At the moment, the way the low-carbon version is, it kind of does feel a bit like greenwashing, in that it’s just so minimal effort,” he said. “It’s just like, ‘We removed images, and let’s not think about anything else.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Whereas, if you’re serious about this, you put some time, effort and design resources into creating an experience that is actually equivalent to what you would say the ‘full experience’ is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Which is why something like this, and the design of the low-carbon version, is super important.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>COP28 organisers previously said that they aimed to ensure this year’s event would be “sustainable and carbon neutral”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its Sustainability Policy, COP28 said its push for climate action and realistic goals would be “reflected in everything we do at COP28 UAE, from the catering suppliers we use, to the transport options available to participants”.

That’s good news on the whole, even though the toggle isn’t having very much effect,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s unfortunate that low-carbon mode isn’t the default, and it doesn’t seem like a lot of consideration has gone into the low-carbon design. It’s still presented as an inferior experience to the end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I actually think that’s a really big deal, as there’s so much stigma associated with making green choices. It’s often spun by politicians and the media to mean reduced quality and going without. Whereas with careful design consideration, it could be a more desirable option, and there’s space for high-profile websites to lead the way on this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Irani said changes to the COP28 website appeared to show it was now using less energy, but “more needs to be done”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It shows they care, the fact that they made changes to the website … It shows that they are paying attention, and they are cognisant of it,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a good first step, but I understand the greenwashing criticism, because it looks like [the ‘low-carbon’ version] been slapped on there as an afterthought, rather than it being the primary reason for building the website and showing what you can do with using less energy and less data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This whole idea of the internet being a carbon-producing machine — it’s not something that’s in the public consciousness yet.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Before and after: COP28’s ‘low carbon’ site on October 25 and 26</h2>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c4e7c5accb8451b5611cc221e4d0037a?src\"><img src=\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c4e7c5accb8451b5611cc221e4d0037a?src\" alt=\"COP28 website on October 26, 2023.\" /></a>COP28 website on October 25, 2023. / COP28 website on October 26, 2023.<blockquote><p><strong>Editor says …Sterling Publishing &amp; Media Service Agency is not responsible for the content of external site or from any reports, posts or links and thanks for following as always appreciate every like, reblog or retweet and comment thank you </strong></p>@acenewsservices </blockquote><a href=\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8a6b234d1e4177ed1dab36bb2f662ff4?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3081&amp;cropW=4622&amp;xPos=377&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575\"><img src=\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8a6b234d1e4177ed1dab36bb2f662ff4?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3081&amp;cropW=4622&amp;xPos=377&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575\" alt=\"A woman in a white labcoat holds up the palms of her hands to the camera.

She initially called the toggle “fake” and said it did “absolutely nothing”.\n\n\n\n“It simply gives the user the impression that they (and the website owners) are considering the planet, without actually changing anything,” she wrote. “A classic example of greenwashing.”\n\n\n\nMs Barker said a low carbon site “should be the default” instead of giving users the option to switch to one, and said the language used by the COP28 website was problematic.\n\n\n\n“The toggle label when low carbon mode is toggled on, ‘Switch back to full experience,’ makes it sound like users are missing out on something by switching on low carbon mode, when in fact (if done right) they could be gaining a better, faster experience,” she said.\n\n\n\nFershad Irani is a freelance web sustainability consultant in Taiwan who is part of the Green Web Foundation. He said he was excited when he first saw COP28’s low-carbon toggle, but was disappointed by its implementation.\n\n\n\n“At the moment, the way the low-carbon version is, it kind of does feel a bit like greenwashing, in that it’s just so minimal effort,” he said. “It’s just like, ‘We removed images, and let’s not think about anything else.’\n\n\n\n“Whereas, if you’re serious about this, you put some time, effort and design resources into creating an experience that is actually equivalent to what you would say the ‘full experience’ is.\n\n\n\n“Which is why something like this, and the design of the low-carbon version, is super important.”\n\n\n\nCOP28 organisers previously said that they aimed to ensure this year’s event would be “sustainable and carbon neutral”.\n\n\n\nIn its Sustainability Policy, COP28 said its push for climate action and realistic goals would be “reflected in everything we do at COP28 UAE, from the catering suppliers we use, to the transport options available to participants”. COP conference attendees have faced criticism in the past for taking private planes to the summit.\n\n\n\nA demonstrator advocates for the 1.5 degree Celsius warming goal at 2022’s COP27 climate summit in Egypt.(AP Photo: Peter Dejong/File)Changes welcomed, but ‘more needs to be done’\n\n\n\nAfter the COP28 website was modified on October 26, Ms Barker said she was pleased to see the site was now using less data, but found the “low carbon” toggle still wasn’t having much of an impact on energy usage.\n\n\n\n“The home page is considerably smaller than before (in terms of data transfer) even with the low-carbon toggle off. That’s good news on the whole, even though the toggle isn’t having very much effect,” she said.\n\n\n\n“It’s unfortunate that low-carbon mode isn’t the default, and it doesn’t seem like a lot of consideration has gone into the low-carbon design. It’s still presented as an inferior experience to the end user.\n\n\n\n“I actually think that’s a really big deal, as there’s so much stigma associated with making green choices. It’s often spun by politicians and the media to mean reduced quality and going without. Whereas with careful design consideration, it could be a more desirable option, and there’s space for high-profile websites to lead the way on this.”\n\n\n\nMr Irani said changes to the COP28 website appeared to show it was now using less energy, but “more needs to be done”.\n\n\n\n“It shows they care, the fact that they made changes to the website … It shows that they are paying attention, and they are cognisant of it,” he said.\n\n\n\n“It’s a good first step, but I understand the greenwashing criticism, because it looks like [the ‘low-carbon’ version] been slapped on there as an afterthought, rather than it being the primary reason for building the website and showing what you can do with using less energy and less data.\n\n\n\n“This whole idea of the internet being a carbon-producing machine — it’s not something that’s in the public consciousness yet.”\n\n\n\nBefore and after: COP28’s ‘low carbon’ site on October 25 and 26\n\n\n\nCOP28 website on October 25, 2023. / COP28 website on October 26, 2023.Editor says …Sterling Publishing & Media Service Agency is not responsible for the content of external site or from any reports, posts or links and thanks for following as always appreciate every like, reblog or retweet and comment thank you @acenewsservices A demonstrator advocates for the 1.5 degree Celsius warming goal at 2022’s COP27 climate summit in Egypt.(AP Photo: Peter Dejong/File)\n\n\n\n@acenewsservices \n\t\t\n\t\tPEACE & TRUTHTweetShare on TumblrTelegramMastodonEmailXMorePocketLike Loading...\n\n\tRelated"

The accurate news is we don’t must append a outlandish class to exterior hyperlinks or alter the markup the least bit. We can merely spend an attribute selector.</p><h2>The usage of attribute selectors</h2><p>CSS permits us to vogue HTML ingredients fixed with their attributes by wrapping them in sq. brackets. As an instance, we can vogue any component with the <code>hidden</code> attribute to accept as true with a <code>teach</code> property of <code>none</code>:</p><pre><code><span>[hidden]</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>teach</span><span>: </span> none<span>;</span><br /><span>}</span></code></pre><p>We can furthermore vogue ingredients when the attribute equals a selected payment. For manufacture ingredients, we would possibly maybe maybe well vogue particular input forms with out having to spend a class:</p><pre><code><span>input[type='checkbox']</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>accent-color</span><span>: </span> deeppink<span>;</span><br /><span>}</span></code></pre><p>For our exterior hyperlinks we’re seeking to coach the styling when the <code>href</code> attribute contains a hyperlink to an exterior region. We don’t know precisely what that payment can be (and it wouldn’t be honorable so as to add every particular person URL to our stylesheet!), nonetheless we know that internal hyperlinks (hyperlinks to diversified posts on the placement) will initiate up with a reduce, whereas exterior hyperlinks will initiate up with <code>https://</code>. So we can vogue solely the hyperlinks that initiate up with <code>http</code> by inserting a <code>^</code> persona into our attribute selector:</p><pre><code><span>a[href^='http']</span> <span>{</span><br /><br /><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Alternatively we can spend diversified operators to resolve diversified styling prerequisites:</p><pre><code><br /><span>a[href='https://css-irl.info']</span><br /><span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></pre><p><code><br /><span>a[href*='css']</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></p><code></code><p><code><br /><span>a[href$='.info']</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></p><code></code><p><code><br /><span>a[class~='link']</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></p><code></code><p>Additionally, by collectively with <code>s</code> or <code>i</code> earlier than the terminate bracket we can protect an eye fixed on whether or no longer they’re when put next case-sensitively or insensitively:</p><pre><code><br /><span>a[href*='css-irl' s]</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></pre><p><code><br /><span>a[href*='css-irl' i]</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>}</span></code></p><code></code><h2>Styling the pseudo component</h2><p>For our exterior hyperlinks, we’ll append an icon by styling a pseudo component. Here we’re the spend of the <code>tell material</code> property with a sinful64 encoded SVG, because the icon is somewhat easy. But it’s seemingly you’ll maybe spend a image URL, yet any other persona, or an emoji.

It uses the intrinsic dimensions of the SVG. If we’re seeking to coach the icon to <strong>any</strong> exterior hyperlink with out reference to font dimension (e.g. a heading), we would possibly maybe maybe well very neatly be better off the spend of the <code>background-image</code> property.

This is enormous indispensable for users, because it lets them know that the link goes to take them somewhere off-position.I’ve factual currently applied customized styling for exterior hyperlinks within posts on this position. The qualified news is we don’t want to append a diverse class to exterior hyperlinks or alter the markup in any come. We are in a position to merely instruct an attribute selector.Utilizing attribute selectorsCSS enables us to sort HTML aspects primarily primarily based completely on their attributes by wrapping them in square brackets. As an instance, we are in a position to sort any ingredient with the hidden attribute to devour a mask property of none:[hidden] {\nmask:  none;\n}We would also additionally sort aspects when the attribute equals a explicit cost. For originate aspects, lets sort explicit enter kinds with out having to make instruct of a class:enter[type='checkbox'] {\naccent-color:  deeppink;\n}For our exterior hyperlinks we want to instruct the styling when the href attribute comprises a link to an exterior position. We don’t know precisely what that cost will likely be (and it wouldn’t be succesful to add every individual URL to our stylesheet!), but all of us know that within hyperlinks (hyperlinks to other posts on the positioning) will birth up with a prick, whereas exterior hyperlinks will birth up with https://. So we are in a position to sort most productive the hyperlinks that birth up with http by inserting a ^ character into our attribute selector:a[href^='http'] {\n\n}Alternatively we are in a position to instruct other operators to hunt out out diverse styling stipulations:\na[href='https://css-irl.info']\n{\n}\na[href*='css'] {\n}\na[href$='.info'] {\n}\na[class~='link'] {\n}Additionally, by adding s or i sooner than the pause bracket we are in a position to control whether they are when compared case-sensitively or insensitively:\na[href*='css-irl' s] {\n}\na[href*='css-irl' i] {\n}Styling the pseudo ingredientFor our exterior hyperlinks, we’ll append an icon by styling a pseudo ingredient. Here we’re the instruct of the impart property with a defective64 encoded SVG, as the icon is extraordinarily easy.

It’s interested to see when it comes to unknown data coming into templates. Here’s a JSX example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"things\"&gt;\n  {things.map(thing =&gt; \n    return(\n      &lt;div class=\"thing\" key=thing.id&gt;\n        &lt;h3 data-category=thing.category&gt;thing.name&lt;/h3&gt;\n        thing.text\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  )\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here I’ve spat out a total arbitrary list of “things”. I found it most useful to have the <code>data-category</code> attribute on the header, as direct styling with that was useful. But what if the parent needs styling based on that? Easy:</p>\n<pre><code>.thing:has([data-category=\"widget\"]) \n   background: yellow;\n</code></pre>\n<p>More, what if the entire group needs a special style? And if it does, make <em>all</em> the headers smaller?</p>\n<pre><code>.things:has([data-category=\"widget\"]) h3 \n  font-size: 80%;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Go down, then back up! </p>\n<p>I’m even very-mindblown-y on the idea that quantity queries are now easy. Does this list have at least 11 items in it? Yes? Then do something:</p>\n<pre><code>ol:has(li:nth-child(11)) \n  color: red;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Get out of dodge.</p>\n<p>We’ve had blend modes in CSS for a while. You use <code>mix-blend-mode</code> when you’re trying to blend an elements <em>content</em> with it’s background. You use <code>background-blend-mode</code> when layering backgrounds and wanting to blend those. </p>\n<p>It still strikes me as a surprisingly cool thing we have access to directly in CSS. And it’s niche enough that when I see it used, it’s usually a pleasant surprise. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/css/blend-modes\">Brad Woods has an awesome article</a> showing off how they work. Interactive examples really does blending justice here. </p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"1022\" src=\"https://blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-05-at-11.54.40%E2%80%AFAM-1024x1022.png\" alt=\"\" /><p>Those look dramatic, but blending can be rather subtle. Brad has all sorts of other examples like blending gradients over images, blending textures, blending patterns, that all end up quite nice and the fact that they are programmatic just feels cool and powerful. </p>\n<p>Koding Kitty has a <a href=\"https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/blend-modes/\">similarly good explanation page</a>, specifically using provided Tailwind class names to do the blending over top a single-color icon. I always thought Robin <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mix-blend-mode/\">did a good job on the old CSS-Tricks page</a> as well. </p>\n<p>You know what I always think of with blending, though? It’s not a CSS property that you just learn and then you know it. All you can learn is the general category of what it can do and the circumstances it might be useful. Then, you have to <em>guess and test</em> your way to a good outcome. One might argue a lot of CSS is that way, but I feel like blending is particularly this way.</p>\n<p>Speaking of excellent interactive tutorials!</p>\n<p>Artur Bień is all over it in <a href=\"https://expensive.toys/blog/blur-vignette\">Blur Vignette effect in CSS</a>.</p>\n<p>How would you pull of this in CSS?</p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blur-vignette-1024x540.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p>Quickly, it’s to layer two copies of the image, blur the top one, and use a mask to only reveal the edges of the blurred version. The hard part is crafting the mask. Artur does it with 6 layered gradients which gets the effect just right. </p>\n<p>Don’t miss the Windows 98-ish interactive demo at the bottom which lets you totally control different aspects of the effect.</p>\n<p>Artur is the master of getting these kind of details right. Check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artur_bien/status/1707130112389378273\">this quick screencast video he tweeted</a> about getting a “glass overlay” effect just right. I’d be like “that’s what <code>backdrop-filter</code> is for!” That’s in there, but it doesn’t account for the, as Artur puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In reality we see glass objects reflecting light even before they are placed directly between our eyes and the light source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well we’ve touched on filters, blending, and masking, I suppose it’s not out of line to hit shadows too. I enjoyed Preethi Sam’s thinking differently in <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/interesting-ways-use-css-shadows/\">A Few Interesting Ways To Use CSS Shadows For More Than Depth</a>. Shadows can have properties that make them quite un-shadow-like, like having zero blur, being inside an element, being whatever color you want, and even being layered. Like <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/abPOwRm\">how good are these hovers</a>?</p>\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"262\" src=\"https://blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-05-at-13.07.44.gif\" alt=\"\" /><p>Nothing wrong with using shadows for shadows though! I ran across <a href=\"https://boxshadows.xyz/\">boxshadows.xyz</a> the other day and it’s a pretty nice tool for doing layered shadows that have a better depth effect than any one shadow alone can do. </p>\n<img src=\"https://blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-05-at-1.23.07%E2%80%AFPM.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:521px;height:505px;\" width=\"521\" height=\"505\" /><p>I just love that sort of look. It’s intense looking in that exact example, but a slightly more subtle version with a bigger shadow behind and a slight lighting effect inset on top is just a really juicy effect that works well on the web.</p>\n<p>You know what else is hot right now? Blurred and colored blobs as backgrounds. As ever, you can make those as images and use a <code>background-image</code> (I’ve seen Figma plugins like <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/955866301003783604\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1270443306587097577\">this)</a>. But it’s fun to do programmatically of course as you can color them as needed, make different sizes, and even animate them.</p>\n<p>Andrew Walpole took a crack at it with <a href=\"https://codepen.io/walpolea/pen/ZERZOaB\">Glowing Blurred Backgrounds with CSS</a>. The <code>filter</code> property does the heavy lifting getting the blurryness going, but getting the shapes together in which to blur is very clever. </p>\n<p>Below the (left) turns to the (right). </p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" src=\"https://blog.codepen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-05-at-1.34.09%E2%80%AFPM-1024x585.png\" alt=\"\" /><p>The post Chris’ Corner: Can Has Blurs, Filters, and Masks appeared first on CodePen Blog.</p>\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://blog.codepen.io/2023/10/09/chris-corner-can-has-blurs-filters-and-masks/\">Source link </a></p>\n                            \n                                    \n                                    \n\t<h2>Continue Reading</h2>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/carlos-correa-booed-by-astros-fans-twins-star-and-josh-reddick-react/\"><span>Previous</span> <span>Previous post:</span> <span></span></a><h4><a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/carlos-correa-booed-by-astros-fans-twins-star-and-josh-reddick-react/\"><span>Carlos Correa booed by Astros fans, Twins star and Josh Reddick react</span></a></h4><a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/carlos-correa-booed-by-astros-fans-twins-star-and-josh-reddick-react/\"><span><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://washingtonread.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rawImage-150x150.webp\" alt=\"\" /></span></a><a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/amazons-invite-only-deals-are-back-for-prime-day-2-here-are-the-best-deals-to-shop/\"><span>Next</span> <span>Next post:</span> <span></span></a><h4><a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/amazons-invite-only-deals-are-back-for-prime-day-2-here-are-the-best-deals-to-shop/\"><span>Amazon’s invite-only deals are back for Prime Day 2: Here are the best deals to shop</span></a></h4><a href=\"https://washingtonread.com/amazons-invite-only-deals-are-back-for-prime-day-2-here-are-the-best-deals-to-shop/\"><span><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://washingtonread.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Amazons-invite-only-deals-are-back-for-Prime-Day-2-Here-150x150.webp\" alt=\"\" /></span></a>",

Does this list have at least 11 items in it? Yes? Then do something:\nol:has(li:nth-child(11)) \n  color: red;\n\nGet out of dodge.\nWe’ve had blend modes in CSS for a while. You use mix-blend-mode when you’re trying to blend an elements content with it’s background. You use background-blend-mode when layering backgrounds and wanting to blend those. \nIt still strikes me as a surprisingly cool thing we have access to directly in CSS. And it’s niche enough that when I see it used, it’s usually a pleasant surprise. \nBrad Woods has an awesome article showing off how they work. Interactive examples really does blending justice here. \nThose look dramatic, but blending can be rather subtle. Brad has all sorts of other examples like blending gradients over images, blending textures, blending patterns, that all end up quite nice and the fact that they are programmatic just feels cool and powerful. \nKoding Kitty has a similarly good explanation page, specifically using provided Tailwind class names to do the blending over top a single-color icon. I always thought Robin did a good job on the old CSS-Tricks page as well. \nYou know what I always think of with blending, though? It’s not a CSS property that you just learn and then you know it. All you can learn is the general category of what it can do and the circumstances it might be useful. Then, you have to guess and test your way to a good outcome. One might argue a lot of CSS is that way, but I feel like blending is particularly this way.\nSpeaking of excellent interactive tutorials!\nArtur Bień is all over it in Blur Vignette effect in CSS.\nHow would you pull of this in CSS?\nQuickly, it’s to layer two copies of the image, blur the top one, and use a mask to only reveal the edges of the blurred version. The hard part is crafting the mask. Artur does it with 6 layered gradients which gets the effect just right. \nDon’t miss the Windows 98-ish interactive demo at the bottom which lets you totally control different aspects of the effect.\nArtur is the master of getting these kind of details right. Check out this quick screencast video he tweeted about getting a “glass overlay” effect just right. I’d be like “that’s what backdrop-filter is for!” That’s in there, but it doesn’t account for the, as Artur puts it:\n\nIn reality we see glass objects reflecting light even before they are placed directly between our eyes and the light source.\n\nWell we’ve touched on filters, blending, and masking, I suppose it’s not out of line to hit shadows too. I enjoyed Preethi Sam’s thinking differently in A Few Interesting Ways To Use CSS Shadows For More Than Depth. Shadows can have properties that make them quite un-shadow-like, like having zero blur, being inside an element, being whatever color you want, and even being layered. Like how good are these hovers?\nNothing wrong with using shadows for shadows though! I ran across boxshadows.xyz the other day and it’s a pretty nice tool for doing layered shadows that have a better depth effect than any one shadow alone can do. \nI just love that sort of look. It’s intense looking in that exact example, but a slightly more subtle version with a bigger shadow behind and a slight lighting effect inset on top is just a really juicy effect that works well on the web.\nYou know what else is hot right now? Blurred and colored blobs as backgrounds. As ever, you can make those as images and use a background-image (I’ve seen Figma plugins like this and this). But it’s fun to do programmatically of course as you can color them as needed, make different sizes, and even animate them.\nAndrew Walpole took a crack at it with Glowing Blurred Backgrounds with CSS. The filter property does the heavy lifting getting the blurryness going, but getting the shapes together in which to blur is very clever. \nBelow the (left) turns to the (right). \nThe post Chris’ Corner: Can Has Blurs, Filters, and Masks appeared first on CodePen Blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource link \n                            \n                                    \n                                    \n\tContinue Reading\n\t\tPrevious Previous post: Carlos Correa booed by Astros fans, Twins star and Josh Reddick reactNext Next post: Amazon’s invite-only deals are back for Prime Day 2: Here are the best deals to shop"

As web applications grow larger, they inevitably fall prey to complexity, despite our best intentions. The prevalence of third-party libraries to solve everyday coding problems is both a blessing and a curse. It can be tempting to reach for an off-the-shelf solution to save time now, but what happens what happens when that dependency is no longer maintained, or when developer needs change? Can you be sure you understand enough of the underlying code to fix any bugs created by pinning all-important functionality on an (often unpaid) open source maintainer?</p>\n<p>We tend to <code>npm install</code> third-party dependencies unthinkingly. But these packages often rely on other dependencies themselves. A quick look in our Node modules folder quickly exposes the web of complexity within, which few of us can really fathom.

        "text": "One of my favourite sessions at All Day Hey conference last month was Jack Franklin’s talk Abstractions, complexities and off-ramps. As web applications grow larger, they inevitably fall prey to complexity, despite our best intentions. The prevalence of third-party libraries to solve everyday coding problems is both a blessing and a curse. It can be tempting to reach for an off-the-shelf solution to save time now, but what happens what happens when that dependency is no longer maintained, or when developer needs change? Can you be sure you understand enough of the underlying code to fix any bugs created by pinning all-important functionality on an (often unpaid) open source maintainer?\nWe tend to npm install third-party dependencies unthinkingly. But these packages often rely on other dependencies themselves. A quick look in our Node modules folder quickly exposes the web of complexity within, which few of us can really fathom. A single point of failure can bring down the entire stack, like the well-worn “house of cards” metaphor.\nComplexity isn’t the only issue, however. More dependencies often result in a bigger Javascript payload delivered to the user, with an accompanying negative impact on performance and the environment.\nA Bundlephobia analysis of create-react-app shows a total package size of 492.5kB and 11 other dependencies.Radical solutions\nOne of Jack’s more radical suggestions is to commit our Node modules to the repository. (You could almost hear the collective gasp of the developers on the room at this point in the talk.) But as he breaks down the reasoning, it makes more and more sense.

(There are plenty more.) Simply using <code>display: none</code> hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called <code>.visually-hidden</code> or <code>.sr-only</code> — something like:</p>\n<pre><code><span>.sr-only</span> <span>{</span><br /><span>border</span><span>:</span> 0 <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>clip</span><span>:</span> <span>rect</span><span>(</span>1px<span>,</span> 1px<span>,</span> 1px<span>,</span> 1px<span>)</span> <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>-webkit-clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>inset</span><span>(</span>50%<span>)</span> <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>inset</span><span>(</span>50%<span>)</span> <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>height</span><span>:</span> 1px <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>overflow</span><span>:</span> hidden <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>margin</span><span>:</span> -1px <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>padding</span><span>:</span> 0 <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>position</span><span>:</span> absolute <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>width</span><span>:</span> 1px <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>white-space</span><span>:</span> nowrap <span>!important</span><span>;</span><br /><span>}</span></code></pre>\n<p>It’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind</a> come with built-in <code>.sr-only</code> classes.</p>\n<p>But as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on <a href=\"https://benmyers.dev/blog/native-visually-hidden/\">why the web needs this as a native feature</a>, there are problems with this.

The following is the process I went through to install the things I need for my setup, written purely to remind me what I did, when I inevitably have to do it again sometime.</p>\n<h2>1. Install VSCode</h2>\n<p>When you’re coding (or indeed, installing anything you need to write code), what’s the first thing you need? A terminal! Sure, I could use built-in one on my MacBook, or download <a href=\"https://iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a>. But I generally use VS Code’s terminal, and since I’ll <strong>definitely</strong> need VS Code for, well, writing code, let’s <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">go ahead and install it right away</a>.</p>\n<h3><code>code</code> command</h3>\n<p>In VS Code we can open a project from the command line by navigating to the project and typing <code>code .</code>. On a Mac, we first need to enable this by running <code>Install 'code' command in PATH</code>. (See the VS Code <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line\">command line docs</a> for more details)</p>\n<h2>2. Use zsh as the default</h2>\n<p>As of macOS 10.15, the default shell is zsh. However, VS Code automatically opens a bash terminal. <a href=\"https://dev.to/nyanev/how-to-use-zsh-in-vs-code-for-mac-39dp\">How to fix this</a>? We need to go into our settings in VS Code, find the property <code>terminal.integrated.shell.osx</code> and change this to <code>zsh</code>.</p>\n<p>We’ll also need to create a <em>.zshrc</em> file by running <code>touch ~/.zshrc</code>. This is a hidden file, so it won’t show up in Finder by default. To <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-show-hidden-files-in-macos\">view hidden files</a> we can run:</p>\n<pre><code>defaults <span>write</span> com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles <span>true</span></code></pre>\n<p>Then close and reopen Finder, and our hidden files should be visible. Now we can open this file in VS Code.</p>\n<h2>3. Xcode Command Line Tools (and Git)</h2>\n<p>For the next steps we’re going to need <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/\">Xcode Command Line Tools</a>. We can download Xcode from the App Store, or use this command.</p>\n<pre><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>\n<p>That gives us a prompt to confirm we want to install the command line developer tools. Yes, we do. As a special bonus, this process also installs <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Git</a>, which we’re definitely going to need, so that’s handy.</p>\n<h2>4. Install Oh My ZSH plugin</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">Oh My Zsh</a> is an open source framework for managing your zsh configuration. It enables us to easily install plugins, change our shell theme, and more. Let’s follow the instructions in the Github repository and install it via the command line:</p>\n<pre><code><span>sh</span> -c <span>\"<span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh<span>)</span></span>\"</span></code></pre>\n<h2>5. NVM</h2>\n<p>I can pretty much guarantee I’m going to need Node installed for <strong>anything</strong> I’m working on. I like to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">NVM</a> (Node Version Manager), which makes it super easy to install and switch between Node versions. The best way I’ve found to install this is using the <a href=\"https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm\">zsh-nvm</a> plugin for Oh My Zsh.</p>\n<p>First we clone the repository to our zsh plugins directory:</p>\n<pre><code><span>git</span> clone https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-nvm</code></pre>\n<p>Then add it to our plugins section of the <em>.zshrc</em> file. We can list plugins like this:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins=(\n  git\n  zsh-nvm\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we should have NVM installed. We can run <code>nvm -v</code> to check.</p>\n<h2>6. Z plugin</h2>\n<p>Another plugin I find really useful is <a href=\"https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z\">Zsh-z</a>, which enables us to jump to commonly-used directories simply by typing <code>z</code> followed by the directory name. We don’t actually need to install it, as it’s now included as part of Oh My Zsh, so we can just add it to our plugins in the <em>.zshrc</em> file:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins=(\n  git\n  zsh-nvm\n  z\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>7. Setting up aliases</h2>\n<p>Finally, I like to set up a few aliases for the terminal commands I use the most. We can add these to our <code>.zshrc</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code>alias gpum='git pull origin main'\nalias gpm='git push origin main'\nalias ga=\"git add .\"\nalias gm='git commit -m'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, you can add any other aliases and plugins you like, as well as change your terminal theme, if that’s your bag. Happy coding!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://css-irl.info/setting-up-a-newish-macbook/\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">* This article was originally published here</a></p>",

Ich hatte mich damals über die pompöse Produktion des Albums und die vielen Streicher beschwert. Auf der Live-Platte kommt das Ganze so rüber, wie ich mir das schon für’s Album gewünscht hätte.

Klar, die Songs sind dieselben und das ist ja auch irgendwie toll. Aber wer will denn einfach nur die Outtakes hören?

        "html": "<img src=\"https://css-irl.info/working-with-color-scales-03.jpg\" alt=\"Temperature chart with threshold scale applied, showing distinct colour bands\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" />Temperature anomaly data from the Global Warming and Climate Change API, visualised with D3<p>There are many different ways of using colour informatively when it comes to data visualization. But we also need to ensure our use of colour conveys the right information, and that it is used accessibly. In this article we’ll walk through some examples of using colour in different types of visualizations with the data visualization library <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">D3.js</a>. Some familiarity with D3 will be assumed, but there will be some helpful pointers regardless of how you create your visualizations.</p>\n<h2>Is colour the best option?</h2>\n<p>Colour can be extremely useful in conveying meaning in our designs. It can also be difficult to get right, and in the worst case could have a negative impact on the user experience. Some colour combinations are difficult to perceive by people with colour blindness or low vision. Some colours might have different cultural significance in different parts of the world, which can affect how they are interpreted in a UI. The colour red might signify warning or danger in the western world, but in East Asian countries often represents happiness and good fortune.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it’s rarely a good idea to rely on colour alone. Before creating a chart, we should consider what other options are available to us for visualizing our data. It’s useful to keep in mind <a href=\"https://webflow.com/blog/gestalt-principles-of-design\">Gestalt principles</a>: size, position, proximity, grouping and contrast could be some other ways to differentiate data, as well as text labels when necessary. On the web we’re lucky because our charts can also be interactive: we can progressively disclose more information to the user, without overwhelming them.</p>\n<h2>Colour scales</h2>\n<p>Assuming we’ve established that colour is important for our visualization, let’s look at some colour scale options. We’re going to be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale\">d3-scale</a> module, and evaluating some different use cases for its various scale functions.</p>\n<h3>Overview of scales</h3>\n<p>The purpose of a scale is to map one range of values to another. In D3 (and data visualization in general), their purpose is to map values in a set of data to a visual representation. We can see the principle illustrated in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/PoEGXjM\">this demo</a>, where hovering on the larger area maps the position on the smaller one.</p>\n<p style=\"height:500px;border:2px solid;margin:1em 0;padding:1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/PoEGXjM\"><br />\n  D3 domain/range</a> by Michelle Barker (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">@michellebarker</a>)<br />\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The input (that is, the data we want to map) is the <strong>domain</strong> and the output (consisting of the range of values our mapped data should result in) is called the <strong>range</strong>.</p>\n<p>D3 has a lot of different scale functions, but we’ll look at a handful that are particularly useful when working with colour in data visualization. To demonstrate we’re going to visualize data from the Global Warming and Climate Change API. To start with we’ll fetch data from <a href=\"https://global-warming.org/api/temperature-api\">this endpoint</a>, which gives us an array of global temperature anomalies from 1893 to the present day. We’ll plot these as a linear gradient in CSS, which will allow us to see the advantages on disadvantages of the different types of scales in action.</p>\n<p>To help visualise the result of applying different colour scales, here is an interactive demo that demonstrates linear, diverging and threshold colour scales — the main ones I’ll be explaining in this article.</p>\n<p style=\"height:489px;border:2px solid;margin:1em 0;padding:1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/NWBZQRj\"><br />\n  D3 color scale visualizer</a> by Michelle Barker (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">@michellebarker</a>)<br />\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Continuous scales</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous-scales\">Continuous scales</a> in D3 enable us to map a continuous, quantitative input domain to a continuous output range. Let’s look at an example of a continuous colour scale using D3’s <code>scaleLinear</code> function. Here we’re creating a function to map a domain of values from 0 to 100 to a continuous colour range from royalblue to pink.</p>\n<pre><code><span>const</span> colorScale <span>=</span> d3<br /><span>.</span><span>scaleLinear</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'royalblue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'pink'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre>\n<p>If we call our colour scale function, passing in a value from 0 to 100 we’ll get a colour that falls somewhere within that range. So <code>colorScale(0)</code> will give us royalblue (output as <code>rgb(173, 216, 230)</code>), <code>colorScale(100)</code> will give us pink (<code>rgb(255, 192, 203)</code>), while <code>colorScale(50)</code> results in a lavender colour (interpolated from blue and pink).</p>\n<img src=\"https://css-irl.info/working-with-color-scales-02.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the resulting colours on the colour scale\" width=\"1035\" height=\"292\" /><br /><h3>Clamping</h3>\n<p>Passing in a value outside of our expected domain can result in some unexpected colours. For example, <code>colorScale(200)</code> results in <code>rgb(255, 255, 181)</code>, a pale yellow colour!</p>\n<img src=\"https://css-irl.info/working-with-color-scales-01.svg\" alt=\"Colour swatches showing the (expected) colour values for 0 and 100, and the unexpected yellow colour for 200\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /><br /><p>A solution is to use the clamp method, which ensures any values outside of the domain will be clamped to the given range, and we won’t get any unexpected results.</p>\n<pre><code><span>const</span> colorScale <span>=</span> d3<br /><span>.</span><span>scaleLinear</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'royalblue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'pink'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span></code></pre>\n<h2>Working with data</h2>\n<p>When working with data it’s likely we’ll want our domain to be determined by the data itself. We can use D3’s <code>extent</code> function to get the highest and lowest values in our dataset as an array.

Using our temperature data, perhaps we want to draw a line graph showing distinct lines for temperature over time during the spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. Spring, summer, autumn and winter are discrete values (they are each distinct), while temperature is continuous.</p>\n<h3>Ordinal scale</h3>\n<p>If we want to colour our lines distinctly for the four seasons we could use an ordinal scale. This maps a discrete input to a discrete output with a 1:1 relationship.</p>\n<pre><code>d3<span>.</span><span>scaleOrdinal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'spring'</span><span>,</span> <span>'summer'</span><span>,</span> <span>'autumn'</span><span>,</span> <span>'winter'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'turquoise'</span><span>,</span> <span>'pink'</span><span>,</span> <span>'orangered'</span><span>,</span> <span>'royalblue'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre>\n<p style=\"height:481px;border:2px solid;margin:1em 0;padding:1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/YzjMMNp\"><br />\n  D3 ordinal colour scale</a> by Michelle Barker (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">@michellebarker</a>)<br />\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We would expect our data to fall into any one of these categories. On the other hand, if we were displaying a bar chart showing the number of survey respondents categorized by gender, there could be some responses that do not conform to our three categories: a respondent might have entered a different gender in their response, or declined to answer. We can use the unknown() method to define a colour for unexpected or undefined values:</p>\n<pre><code>d3<span>.</span><span>scaleOrdinal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'male'</span><span>,</span> <span>'female'</span><span>,</span> <span>'non-binary'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'blue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'cornflowerblue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'lightblue'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>unknown</span><span>(</span><span>'grey'</span><span>)</span></code></pre>\n<h3>Threshold scale</h3>\n<p>A threshold scale is useful when we have continuous numerical input that we want to map to a discrete output. In our temperature data, it could be difficult to determine small changes in temperature when using a continuous colour scale. But using a threshold scale, we can show when the temperature crosses a given threshold, and provide visually distinct colours (see <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/NWBZQRj\">the demo</a>). The scale’s domain should consist of the threshold boundaries.</p>\n<pre><code><span>const</span> colorScaleThreshold <span>=</span> d3<br /><span>.</span><span>scaleThreshold</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>-</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.25</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>,</span> <span>0.75</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br /><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'royalblue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'lightblue'</span><span>,</span> <span>'azure'</span><span>,</span> <span>'pink'</span><span>,</span> <span>'hotpink'</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre>\n<p>If we use this scale for our temperature data we can clearly see the marked increase in temperature anomalies in the early part of this century.

        "text": "Temperature anomaly data from the Global Warming and Climate Change API, visualised with D3There are many different ways of using colour informatively when it comes to data visualization. But we also need to ensure our use of colour conveys the right information, and that it is used accessibly. In this article we’ll walk through some examples of using colour in different types of visualizations with the data visualization library D3.js. Some familiarity with D3 will be assumed, but there will be some helpful pointers regardless of how you create your visualizations.\nIs colour the best option?\nColour can be extremely useful in conveying meaning in our designs. It can also be difficult to get right, and in the worst case could have a negative impact on the user experience. Some colour combinations are difficult to perceive by people with colour blindness or low vision. Some colours might have different cultural significance in different parts of the world, which can affect how they are interpreted in a UI. The colour red might signify warning or danger in the western world, but in East Asian countries often represents happiness and good fortune.\nTherefore, it’s rarely a good idea to rely on colour alone. Before creating a chart, we should consider what other options are available to us for visualizing our data. It’s useful to keep in mind Gestalt principles: size, position, proximity, grouping and contrast could be some other ways to differentiate data, as well as text labels when necessary. On the web we’re lucky because our charts can also be interactive: we can progressively disclose more information to the user, without overwhelming them.\nColour scales\nAssuming we’ve established that colour is important for our visualization, let’s look at some colour scale options. We’re going to be using the d3-scale module, and evaluating some different use cases for its various scale functions.\nOverview of scales\nThe purpose of a scale is to map one range of values to another. In D3 (and data visualization in general), their purpose is to map values in a set of data to a visual representation. We can see the principle illustrated in this demo, where hovering on the larger area maps the position on the smaller one.\n\n  See the Pen \n\n  D3 domain/range by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nThe input (that is, the data we want to map) is the domain and the output (consisting of the range of values our mapped data should result in) is called the range.\nD3 has a lot of different scale functions, but we’ll look at a handful that are particularly useful when working with colour in data visualization. To demonstrate we’re going to visualize data from the Global Warming and Climate Change API. To start with we’ll fetch data from this endpoint, which gives us an array of global temperature anomalies from 1893 to the present day. We’ll plot these as a linear gradient in CSS, which will allow us to see the advantages on disadvantages of the different types of scales in action.\nTo help visualise the result of applying different colour scales, here is an interactive demo that demonstrates linear, diverging and threshold colour scales — the main ones I’ll be explaining in this article.\n\n  See the Pen \n\n  D3 color scale visualizer by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nContinuous scales\nContinuous scales in D3 enable us to map a continuous, quantitative input domain to a continuous output range. Let’s look at an example of a continuous colour scale using D3’s scaleLinear function. Here we’re creating a function to map a domain of values from 0 to 100 to a continuous colour range from royalblue to pink.\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleLinear()\n.domain([0, 100])\n.range(['royalblue', 'pink'])\nIf we call our colour scale function, passing in a value from 0 to 100 we’ll get a colour that falls somewhere within that range. So colorScale(0) will give us royalblue (output as rgb(173, 216, 230)), colorScale(100) will give us pink (rgb(255, 192, 203)), while colorScale(50) results in a lavender colour (interpolated from blue and pink).\n\nClamping\nPassing in a value outside of our expected domain can result in some unexpected colours. For example, colorScale(200) results in rgb(255, 255, 181), a pale yellow colour!\n\nA solution is to use the clamp method, which ensures any values outside of the domain will be clamped to the given range, and we won’t get any unexpected results.\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleLinear()\n.domain([0, 100])\n.range(['royalblue', 'pink'])\n.clamp(true)\nWorking with data\nWhen working with data it’s likely we’ll want our domain to be determined by the data itself. We can use D3’s extent function to get the highest and lowest values in our dataset as an array. We can pass in a simple array, for example:\nd3.extent([0, 20, 50, 100]) // result: [0, 100]\nAlternatively we can use an accessor function, if we want to use a particular attribute from our data. Let’s fetch some data from the Global Warming and Climate Change API and use the extent function to get the domain based on land temperature anomaly values from the dataset. We’ll write a new function called draw to do this, seeing as we’ll be using it quite a bit later on:\n/* Fetch data */\nfetch('https://global-warming.org/api/temperature-api')\n.then((response) => response.json())\n.then((response) => {\nconst data = downsampleData(response.result)\ndraw(data)\n})\n.catch((error) => error)\n\n/* Accessor function to get the land temperature from the datum */\nconst yAccessor = (d) => parseFloat(d.land)\n\nconst draw = (data) => {\n/* Retrieve the lowest and highest temperatures from our data */\nconst domain = d3.extent(data, yAccessor) // result: [-0.481, 1.018]\n\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleLinear()\n.domain(domain)\n.range(['pink', 'blue'])\n.clamp(true)\n}\nThe request response contains quite high resolution data. In the demo we’re using a function to downsample the data so that we are working with the average temperature anomaly on a yearly rather than monthly basis. This might not be necessary for your own dataset.\nLet’s use our linear colour scale with our data to render a an SVG with a gradient fill that corresponds to temperature anomaly values over time — where higher temperatures are represented by colours towards the pink end of the scale and lower temperatures by bluer colours.\n/* In our draw function */\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleLinear()\n.domain(domain)\n.range(['pink', 'royalblue'])\n.clamp(true)\n\n/* Create SVG */\nconst svg = chart\n.append('svg')\n.attr('width', 600)\n.attr('height', 400)\n.attr('viewBox', '0 0 600 400')\n\n/* Append <defs> element containing <linearGradient>, where we will define the gradient to use */\nconst gradient = svg.append('defs').append('linearGradient').attr('id', 'grad1')\n\n/* Create the gradient stops from our data */\ndata.forEach((d, index) => {\nconst color = colorScale(yAccessor(d))\nconst step = 100 / data.length\n\n  gradient.append('stop').attr('offset', 0).attr('stop-colour', color)\n\n  gradient\n.append('stop')\n.attr('offset', `${index * step}%`)\n.attr('stop-colour', color)\n})\n\n/* Create a rectangle and fill it with the gradient background */\nsvg\n.append('rect')\n.attr('x', 0)\n.attr('y', 0)\n.attr('width', 600)\n.attr('height', 400)\n.attr('fill', 'url(#grad1)')\nWe could use a CSS gradient for this particular visualisation, but if we want to create a more complex chart that includes axes, labels, and more information, using an SVG is much more versatile.\n\nNote, when we use a linear scale both our domain and range can include a greater number of values, but it generally works best if both arrays are of the same length. In this example colorScale(0) will map to dark violet, colorScale(100) will map to red, and so on.\nd3.scaleLinear()\n.domain([-100, 0, 100])\n.range(['lightblue', 'darkviolet', 'red'])\nDiverging scales\nWe can in fact use a different scale function for creating diverging colour scales: scaleDiverging always takes three values for its domain, similar to our linear scale function above. But instead of a range, we can specify an interpolator. D3 provides a bunch of colour scheme interpolators in its d3-scale-chromatic module. The interpolator d3.interpolateRdYlBu is perfect for our temperature data, as it goes from red, through neutral colours, to dark blue. It also has a good degree of tonal contrast, with the lightness of the colours decreasing towards either end of the scale. This makes it more accessible for users that might find it difficult to perceive changes in hue.\nWe’ll flip the domain around in this instance, so that higher values will be represented by colours towards the red end of the scale and vice versa. We’re setting a middle value of 0, as 0 represents no temperature anomaly, which should be represented by a neutral colour.\nLet’s apply this scale to our dataset.\n/* Replace the previous `colorScale` value in our draw function: */\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleDiverging(d3.interpolateRdYlBu)\n.domain([domain[1], 0, domain[0]])\n\n  See the Pen \n\n  D3 colour scale linear (diverging) by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nInterpolation\nAs we have seen, D3’s scale functions interpolate between two (or more) colours to produce hues that fall anywhere between those in our specified colour range. We can choose how the colours are interpolated on a linear scale using D3’s various interpolation methods. Specifying interpolateCubeHelix as an interpolation method, for example, will yield quite a different result to interpolateRGB.\nconst colorScale = d3\n.scaleLinear()\n.domain([0, 100])\n.range(['royalblue', 'pink'])\n.interpolate(d3.interpolateCubehelix)\ncolour interpolation is a huge topic, beyond the scope of this article. Check out the documentation on colour spaces in the d3-interpolate module for details of the various interpolation methods available in D3 — and try playing around with them to see the different results.\nDiscrete scales\nWe’re going to take a look at two of D3’s scale functions for working with discrete data — data that consists of individual or countable values. Using our temperature data, perhaps we want to draw a line graph showing distinct lines for temperature over time during the spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. Spring, summer, autumn and winter are discrete values (they are each distinct), while temperature is continuous.\nOrdinal scale\nIf we want to colour our lines distinctly for the four seasons we could use an ordinal scale. This maps a discrete input to a discrete output with a 1:1 relationship.\nd3.scaleOrdinal()\n.domain(['spring', 'summer', 'autumn', 'winter'])\n.range(['turquoise', 'pink', 'orangered', 'royalblue'])\n\n  See the Pen \n\n  D3 ordinal colour scale by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nWe would expect our data to fall into any one of these categories. On the other hand, if we were displaying a bar chart showing the number of survey respondents categorized by gender, there could be some responses that do not conform to our three categories: a respondent might have entered a different gender in their response, or declined to answer. We can use the unknown() method to define a colour for unexpected or undefined values:\nd3.scaleOrdinal()\n.domain(['male', 'female', 'non-binary'])\n.range(['blue', 'cornflowerblue', 'lightblue'])\n.unknown('grey')\nThreshold scale\nA threshold scale is useful when we have continuous numerical input that we want to map to a discrete output. In our temperature data, it could be difficult to determine small changes in temperature when using a continuous colour scale. But using a threshold scale, we can show when the temperature crosses a given threshold, and provide visually distinct colours (see the demo). The scale’s domain should consist of the threshold boundaries.\nconst colorScaleThreshold = d3\n.scaleThreshold()\n.domain([-0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75])\n.range(['royalblue', 'lightblue', 'azure', 'pink', 'hotpink'])\nIf we use this scale for our temperature data we can clearly see the marked increase in temperature anomalies in the early part of this century. For finer detail, we could increase the number of colour thresholds.\n\nRather than manually set our threshold colours, we could compute these from our linear or diverging scales.\n/* In our draw function: */\n\n/* Create the continuous colour scale to interpolate threshold colour values */\nconst colorScaleDiverging = d3\n.scaleDiverging(d3.interpolateRdYlBu)\n.domain(linearDomain)\n.clamp(true)\n\n/* Create the threshold scale domain - equally spaced values from the data extent */\nconst totalThresholds = 8\n// Calculate the value between each threshold\nconst step = (domain[1] - domain[0]) / totalThresholds\n\nconst thresholdScaleDomain = d3.range(totalThresholds).map((d) => {\nreturn (d + 1) * step + domain[0]\n})\n\n/* Create the threshold scale range using our previous colour scale function. It sould have the same number of values as the domain */\nlet thresholdScaleRange = thresholdScaleDomain.map((d) => {\nreturn colorScaleDiverging(d)\n})\n\nthresholdScaleRange = [\ncolorScaleLinear(domain[0]), // include the lowest threshold, so we don't miss out on the first colour\n...thresholdScaleRange,\n]\n\n/* Use these in our new colour scale function */\nconst colorScaleThreshold = d3\n.scaleThreshold()\n.domain(thresholdScaleDomain)\n.range(thresholdScaleRange)\nUsing a threshold scale rather than a linear scale, we can more clearly see the temperature contrast over the long term with getting too granular. Reducing the number of thresholds creates a starker visual disparity between the beginning of the last century and recent years, as we can clearly see the proportion of data that falls above given thresholds. Try adjusting the number of thresholds in this demo to see the impact.\n\n  See the Pen \n\n  D3 colour scale threshold (diverging) by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nHopefully this article has given you a good overview of where different types of scales might come useful when working with colour and data visualisation.\n* This article was originally published here"

Elements in HTML don’t just overlap each other by default. In fact, they intentionally push other elements around so that they don’t. You’ll need CSS to force elements to overlap if you need them to. The traditional ways:</p>\n<ul><li>negative margins</li>\n<li>transform translate</li>\n<li>absolute positioning</li>\n</ul><p>But Chen Hui Jing makes sure we don’t forget about grid! It might not come to mind immediately as we mostly think about making a grid and placing individual elements in individual grid cells. But grid cells don’t care! You can put as many elements as you want in a grid cell (or multiple grid cells). They are really just placement coordinates, not slots that only take one element.</p>\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1673647137/Screenshot-2023-01-13-at-1.57.49-PM/Screenshot-2023-01-13-at-1.57.49-PM.png?_i=AA\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1040\" src=\"http://wisewebinnovations.com/chris-corner-relatively-recent-great-css-writing/image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxOTQ4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNDAiPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiPjxhbmltYXRlIGF0dHJpYnV0ZU5hbWU9ImZpbGwiIHZhbHVlcz0icmdiYSgxNTMsMTUzLDE1MywwLjUpO3JnYmEoMTUzLDE1MywxNTMsMC4xKTtyZ2JhKDE1MywxNTMsMTUzLDAuNSkiIGR1cj0iMnMiIHJlcGVhdENvdW50PSJpbmRlZmluaXRlIiAvPjwvcmVjdD48L3N2Zz4=\" alt=\"\" /></a><h3>Michelle Barker, <a href=\"https://css-irl.info/quick-tip-negative-animation-delay/\">Quick Tip: Negative Animation Delay</a></h3>\n<p>This is one of my favorite classic CSS tricks because it’s so obvious… but only after you’ve learned it.

Charlotte explores using 1️⃣ multiple gradient backgrounds (very complicated to construct, limitations with transparency), 2️⃣ border-image (one of the weirder CSS properties, but does help with placing gradients, or SVGs), 3️⃣ mask-border which I’m not sure I’ve ever even looked at in my life (no Firefox support), and finally, 4️⃣ Houdini which has no Firefox or Safari support, but does bring interesting JavaScript-powered opportunities into the mix.\nJust to throw another one in the mix here… I happened to be playing with Open Props the other day and it has a “Mask Corner Cuts” section. It just uses mask (or -webkit-mask, as apparently the vendor-prefixed version alone gets the best support). \n\n\nScott Vandehey, The Power of CSS Blend Modes\nScott is inspired by other-Scott’s Pen (which happens to be #91 on the Top Pens of 2022 list) and breaks down exactly how it works. It’s a combination of filtering and blending layers. that’s just cool as heck. \nYou gotta go check out the article to see how Scott was able to stretch the idea to other effects, like a halftone filter. \nKate Rose Morley, Tree views in CSS\nThis is entirely doable in just semantic HTML and CSS alone:\nThe trick is putting all the list items that have a sub-list with a <details> element. The text of that <li> becomes whatever the <summary> is. Then you can style the ::marker of the details elements to have the plus-and-minus look rather than the default triangle. I appreciated Kate’s usage of :focus-visible too which keeps the focus styles away from mouse clicks. \nThe post Chris’ Corner: Relatively Recent Great CSS Writing appeared first on CodePen Blog."

Other folks who consistently salvage voice believe discovered to salvage a behavior out of it. I read <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\">“Atomic Habits”</a> by James Obvious a couple of months in the past and its message kinda caught with me.

The trick is to employ amounts of time which shall be so small you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally’t presumably <strong>no longer</strong> match them on your time desk. It could possibly presumably no longer be ample for a completely-fledged article, but ample to salvage a behavior.</p><p>It’s additionally worth noting that your writing doesn’t constantly would possibly presumably perhaps additionally peaceful be wisely-crafted longform blogposts.

I don’t know anything else particular, so why grief?</p><p>The real fact is that <em>each person</em> has something interesting to pronounce attributable to each person faces assorted challenges. You don’t desire to head viral and salvage buzzword-riddled thinkpieces about the original hot topic – There’s ample sites who already carry out that, and <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">AI will at the moment salvage a shitton more of it</a>.</p><p>An even bigger opinion is to write down about what you already know and journey on your day-to-day life as a replacement.

How can I ever submit anything else when webmentions are no longer utilized but?” We decide to tinker with our internet sites and that’s cold, but at some level it gets in the form of in actuality <em>the utilization of</em> your blog and rising voice.</p><p>Despite what we affirm ourselves, it in actuality doesn’t matter too noteworthy how a blog appears to be like to be or what substances it has. Other folks come for the voice, and as lengthy as they would possibly be able to read it, they’re overjoyed. Throw in an RSS feed so each person can employ their believe reader and also you’re golden.

The novelty has used off and that assorted submit is a lot better than what I would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe give you anyway, I affirm myself.</p><p>That’s no longer a exact reason pointless to hiss, no one has a monopoly on a topic. Others would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe already lined the topic – but no longer on your direct, no longer from your standpoint. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally write a submit about the exact similar part and peaceful present precious files the assorted author has missed. Otherwise you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally formula the topic from a assorted angle, for a assorted skill-level or for a assorted viewers.</p><p>Any other draw is to read the cloth that is already accessible and clutch notes about your total questions you continue to believe afterwards. Strive to in spite of all the pieces carry out the part (write the code, employ the app, no matter) and seek for what assorted files would believe been precious for you to believe. Write that!</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-the-moment-for-this-has-passed\">#</a> The second for this has passed</h2><p>There are writing solutions which shall be impressed by some match or dialog. Perhaps something huge took space on the ranking or I’ve had an extraordinarily interesting discussion on social media. So I sketch out a short outline for a submit and stick it in my <code>drafts</code> folder, thinking I’ll bag help to it later.</p><p>Three weeks cross and that lonely draft sits around gathering dust, and by the time I undergo in solutions it, the second has passed. The dialog has moved on, and so the submit is abandoned and at final deleted.</p><p>The ranking strikes rather rapidly and there’s constantly a “hot topic of the day”, but that doesn’t imply that no-one is attracted to anything else. A gracious looking out part about blogs is that they’re asynchronous. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally honest write things and keep them accessible, and even supposing they don’t hit a nerve straight, folks can take into legend them of their believe time.</p><p>Older posts can additionally bag re-stumbled on years later and bag a second wind, no longer to tag that americans consistently peek for particular things – and your submit shall be honest what they’re attempting to collect then! Some of my veteran posts about <a href=\"http://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/\">webrings</a> and the IndieWeb believe currently stumbled on readers as soon as more since Twitter has started going on the drain.

For a non-native english speaker fancy myself, it could well as soon as at the moment be ambitious to write down in a international language. It is a ways a barrier in phrases of manufacturing “polished” text – there’s additional brain cycles occupied with getting your solutions to “sound” upright.</p><p>This is in a position to presumably additionally very wisely be no longer an infinite deal though. Other folks don’t anticipate to read world-class literature as soon as they come to study out a blogpost about “Lobster Mode”. As lengthy as you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally bag your level all the draw thru, it’s swish when you happen to don’t employ esteem phrases. It must additionally be an benefit: for a world viewers, easy English would possibly presumably perhaps additionally even be more uncomplicated to raise finish.</p><p>That being mentioned, that is a usecase the establish AI would possibly presumably perhaps additionally in actuality be precious! While <abbr title=\"Large Language Models\">LLMs</abbr> fancy GPT-3 and co are <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/01/28/decoding-the-hype-about-ai\">ineffective at rising exact voice</a> or usual solutions, they’re gargantuan at making sentences sound constructive.

Every person wants their voice to be considered, and social validation is the candy candy dopamine reward we all crave.</p><p>There’s nothing unfavorable with sharing your work on social media or standard orange link aggregators either, but as soon as at the moment there honest gained’t be noteworthy of a reaction after you submit. That would possibly presumably feel stressful – but in the extinguish I mediate obesessing over conceitedness metrics is no longer worth it anyway. Just attributable to something doesn’t salvage the frontpage of Reddit does no longer imply it’s no longer precious.</p><p>Don’t underestimate how many americans actively read deepest blogs though!

In my case, I’ve been in actuality swamped with client initiatives and assorted work final 365 days.I mediate when you happen to essentially desire to write down though, it’s more a lack of routine than a lack of time itself. Other folks who consistently salvage voice believe discovered to salvage a behavior out of it. I read “Atomic Habits” by James Obvious a couple of months in the past and its message kinda caught with me. It’s about conditioning your self to preserve up out sure things more as soon as at the moment by constructing a routine.Use 15 minutes each day forward of you take a look at your email and honest write. Or carry out it on your shuttle to work if that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate! The trick is to employ amounts of time which shall be so small you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally’t presumably no longer match them on your time desk. It could possibly presumably no longer be ample for a completely-fledged article, but ample to salvage a behavior.It’s additionally worth noting that your writing doesn’t constantly would possibly presumably perhaps additionally peaceful be wisely-crafted longform blogposts. It must honest be a couple of paragraphs about your solutions, linking out to assorted stuff. Chris does a gargantuan job at this, and others believe currently adopted even shorter formats, mimicking social media posts in dimension.# I don’t believe anything else interesting to pronounceThe classic impostor syndrome comes out right here. I don’t know anything else particular, so why grief?The real fact is that each person has something interesting to pronounce attributable to each person faces assorted challenges. You don’t desire to head viral and salvage buzzword-riddled thinkpieces about the original hot topic – There’s ample sites who already carry out that, and AI will at the moment salvage a shitton more of it.An even bigger opinion is to write down about what you already know and journey on your day-to-day life as a replacement. Authentic posts are constantly precious, and also you are going to solidify your believe files in the technique too.Right here are a couple of total writing prompts and examples for blogposts I decide to read:“I learnt something” (TIL)\nMichelle Barker: Negative Animation Lengthen“I realized something”\nDave Rupert: I’m Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo (and Bing)“I constructed something”\nLynn Fisher: lynnandtonic.com Refresh365 days in Review\nSophie Koonin: 2022: The 365 days in listsNon-public Stuff!\nCassie Evans: My regular day# I gotta fix [X] on my space firstThis one is particularly standard among developers. “How can I that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate write anything else forward of the typography is gracious? How can I ever submit anything else when webmentions are no longer utilized but?” We decide to tinker with our internet sites and that’s cold, but at some level it gets in the form of in actuality the utilization of your blog and rising voice.Despite what we affirm ourselves, it in actuality doesn’t matter too noteworthy how a blog appears to be like to be or what substances it has. Other folks come for the voice, and as lengthy as they would possibly be able to read it, they’re overjoyed. Throw in an RSS feed so each person can employ their believe reader and also you’re golden. It bother me to pronounce it but Manuel is de facto upright right here.And if he would possibly presumably perhaps additionally additionally be “redesigning in the originate” for three years while churning out huge amounts of CSS files, your space shall be swish too. 😉# Others believe already written about thisIn most cases I’ve got a gargantuan thought for a submit, but an initial Google search finds that somebody else already beat me to it. The novelty has used off and that assorted submit is a lot better than what I would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe give you anyway, I affirm myself.That’s no longer a exact reason pointless to hiss, no one has a monopoly on a topic. Others would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe already lined the topic – but no longer on your direct, no longer from your standpoint. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally write a submit about the exact similar part and peaceful present precious files the assorted author has missed. Otherwise you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally formula the topic from a assorted angle, for a assorted skill-level or for a assorted viewers.Any other draw is to read the cloth that is already accessible and clutch notes about your total questions you continue to believe afterwards. Strive to in spite of all the pieces carry out the part (write the code, employ the app, no matter) and seek for what assorted files would believe been precious for you to believe. Write that!# The second for this has passedThere are writing solutions which shall be impressed by some match or dialog. Perhaps something huge took space on the ranking or I’ve had an extraordinarily interesting discussion on social media. So I sketch out a short outline for a submit and stick it in my drafts folder, thinking I’ll bag help to it later.Three weeks cross and that lonely draft sits around gathering dust, and by the time I undergo in solutions it, the second has passed. The dialog has moved on, and so the submit is abandoned and at final deleted.The ranking strikes rather rapidly and there’s constantly a “hot topic of the day”, but that doesn’t imply that no-one is attracted to anything else. A gracious looking out part about blogs is that they’re asynchronous. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally honest write things and keep them accessible, and even supposing they don’t hit a nerve straight, folks can take into legend them of their believe time.Older posts can additionally bag re-stumbled on years later and bag a second wind, no longer to tag that americans consistently peek for particular things – and your submit shall be honest what they’re attempting to collect then! Some of my veteran posts about webrings and the IndieWeb believe currently stumbled on readers as soon as more since Twitter has started going on the drain. You by no draw know!# I will’t bag it to sound uprightA couple of the (tech) blogs I read are in English, even supposing its authors are from all the draw thru the arena. For a non-native english speaker fancy myself, it could well as soon as at the moment be ambitious to write down in a international language. It is a ways a barrier in phrases of manufacturing “polished” text – there’s additional brain cycles occupied with getting your solutions to “sound” upright.This is in a position to presumably additionally very wisely be no longer an infinite deal though. Other folks don’t anticipate to read world-class literature as soon as they come to study out a blogpost about “Lobster Mode”. As lengthy as you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally bag your level all the draw thru, it’s swish when you happen to don’t employ esteem phrases. It must additionally be an benefit: for a world viewers, easy English would possibly presumably perhaps additionally even be more uncomplicated to raise finish.That being mentioned, that is a usecase the establish AI would possibly presumably perhaps additionally in actuality be precious! While LLMs fancy GPT-3 and co are ineffective at rising exact voice or usual solutions, they’re gargantuan at making sentences sound constructive. Instruments fancy Jasper can rewrite your reproduction and beef up the tone with out changing the contained files. Form of fancy prettier but for English prose.# Nobody’s going to read it anywayLet’s be correct: no one likes to yowl into the void. Every person wants their voice to be considered, and social validation is the candy candy dopamine reward we all crave.There’s nothing unfavorable with sharing your work on social media or standard orange link aggregators either, but as soon as at the moment there honest gained’t be noteworthy of a reaction after you submit. That would possibly presumably feel stressful – but in the extinguish I mediate obesessing over conceitedness metrics is no longer worth it anyway. Just attributable to something doesn’t salvage the frontpage of Reddit does no longer imply it’s no longer precious.Don’t underestimate how many americans actively read deepest blogs though! The ranking dev community is particularly eager by RSS, and with the Fediverse gaining more and more recognition, usual voice on your believe enviornment has a seriously better attain now than forward of.Who’s gonna read your deepest blog attributable to it has an RSS feed? I’m gonna read your deepest blog attributable to it has an RSS feed. pic.twitter.com/mtcyKhEVet— Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) January 7, 2020···Correct, I perceive it’s a small bit uncommon to write down a submit about how I don’t write posts. However I’m hoping to push help on this in 2023 and gather more time for writing. I additionally suspect that assorted folks believe identical reasons and perhaps talking about them helps a small bit.Despite all the pieces, that’s one more submit in the monetary institution!Read More💦Continue ReadingPrevious: Glovo lays off 6% of personnel following original swish from Spanish executiveNext: Unique Distro ‘BlendOS’ Combines Arch Linux, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu"

Elements in HTML don’t just overlap each other by default. In fact, they intentionally push other elements around so that they don’t. You’ll need CSS to force elements to overlap if you need them to. The traditional ways:</p>\n<ul><li>negative margins</li>\n<li>transform translate</li>\n<li>absolute positioning</li>\n</ul><p>But Chen Hui Jing makes sure we don’t forget about grid! It might not come to mind immediately as we mostly think about making a grid and placing individual elements in individual grid cells. But grid cells don’t care! You can put as many elements as you want in a grid cell (or multiple grid cells).
