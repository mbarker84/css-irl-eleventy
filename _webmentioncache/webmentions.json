Elements in HTML don’t just overlap each other by default. In fact, they intentionally push other elements around so that they don’t. You’ll need CSS to force elements to overlap if you need them to. The traditional ways:</p>\n<ul><li>negative margins</li>\n<li>transform translate</li>\n<li>absolute positioning</li>\n</ul><p>But Chen Hui Jing makes sure we don’t forget about grid! It might not come to mind immediately as we mostly think about making a grid and placing individual elements in individual grid cells. But grid cells don’t care! You can put as many elements as you want in a grid cell (or multiple grid cells).

The point is mainly <strong>staggered</strong> animations. If you want animations to all be at different points along the same animation when they start animating, you can use <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay\">animation-delay</a></code>. But if you use a positive time value, the animation won’t start for the first time until that delay (duh). So instead, you use a <em>negative</em> value. The animation starts immediately, but backed up to where it needs to be to have the beginning of the animation hit once the negative delay elapses.</p>\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1673796545/quick-tip-negative-animation-delay/quick-tip-negative-animation-delay.webp?_i=AA\"><img width=\"758\" height=\"383\" src=\"http://cheapnewhost.com/chris-corner-relatively-recent-great-css-writing/image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3NTgiIGhlaWdodD0iMzgzIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIj48YW5pbWF0ZSBhdHRyaWJ1dGVOYW1lPSJmaWxsIiB2YWx1ZXM9InJnYmEoMTUzLDE1MywxNTMsMC41KTtyZ2JhKDE1MywxNTMsMTUzLDAuMSk7cmdiYSgxNTMsMTUzLDE1MywwLjUpIiBkdXI9IjJzIiByZXBlYXRDb3VudD0iaW5kZWZpbml0ZSIgLz48L3JlY3Q+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" /></a><h3>Charlotte Dann, <a href=\"https://charlottedann-4mjqyxw5t-pouretrebelle.vercel.app/article/fancy-frames-with-css\">Fancy Frames with CSS</a></h3>\n<p>Awesome research from Charlotte, covering lots of ways to make interesting “framed” shapes like these:</p>\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1673796899/Screenshot-2023-01-15-at-7.29.25-AM/Screenshot-2023-01-15-at-7.29.25-AM.png?_i=AA\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"736\" src=\"http://cheapnewhost.com/chris-corner-relatively-recent-great-css-writing/image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjIyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjczNiI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSI+PGFuaW1hdGUgYXR0cmlidXRlTmFtZT0iZmlsbCIgdmFsdWVzPSJyZ2JhKDE1MywxNTMsMTUzLDAuNSk7cmdiYSgxNTMsMTUzLDE1MywwLjEpO3JnYmEoMTUzLDE1MywxNTMsMC41KSIgZHVyPSIycyIgcmVwZWF0Q291bnQ9ImluZGVmaW5pdGUiIC8+PC9yZWN0Pjwvc3ZnPg==\" alt=\"\" /></a><p>So is there one obvious clear best path forward to do this in CSS (and friends)?
