[Reality Check](https://set.studio/category/reality-check/) is a new article series from [Set Studio](https://set.studio) that focuses on CSS layout with real-world case studies. Each issue takes a design from Dribbble (or a similar platform) and demonstrates how to code it in CSS in a way that plays to the strengths of the medium, rather than aiming for pixel-perfect recreations. As Andy says in the first article:

> You have no idea what context your users will be visiting your site in and being the browser’s mentor, not it’s micromanager is a guaranteed way to build truly responsive front-ends that work for everyone.

Andy advocates solid, HTML-first principles and makes use of his [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology. He does a great job of explaining every step of the process of coding, including **why** he advises building in a particular way, and any trade-offs and accessibility considerations that the designer might not have considered. You’ll find some great attention to detail, such as use of the `prefers-contrast` media query in the second edition, and why you might want to consider `align-items: baseline` rather than `center` in flexbox.

I love these type of posts, not only because they feature realistic examples, but because they contain plenty of lessons that will set you up for building **any** project, regardless of the design. I consider myself fairly competent when it comes to CSS layout, and I still find myself learning something new from people like Andy.

I highly recommend this series for anyone wanting to become more confident with CSS layout, and CSS in general.
