My iPhone 8 is still going, four years after I bought it. That shouldn’t be a great achievement, but somehow it is. The battery life isn’t great (it’s already been replaced once), some apps are noticeably slower, and Apple have announced that the iPhone 8 won’t support the iOS 17 update, which means I’ll have to seriously consider upgrading in the not-too-distant future. I’m hoping to make it to the five-year mark, but we’ll see.

On Black Friday, it feels like we’re constantly bombarded with the latest deals to tempt us into buying new tech that we otherwise wouldn’t consider. But hardware has an environmental cost, both in its manufacture and it’s disposal. There is the embodied carbon associated with the manufacturing process, the chemical pollution, the rare metals used in manufacture, and the hazards of e-waste disposal.

## Right to repair

Apple products have been criticised for their built-in obsolescence, and Apple has been accused of making it difficult for non-Apple technicians to repair their products, meaning that users often feel they have to discard old devices after a few years and upgrade. This seems to be changing slowly, with many people who recognise the appalling quantity of e-waste these policies cause pushing for the [right to repair](https://repair.eu/) — although critics argue that Apple’s commitment so far [doesn’t go far enough](https://repair.eu/news/apples-self-repair-programme-is-not-the-right-to-repair-we-need/). In the UK, the [Restart Project](https://therestartproject.org/right-to-repair/), campaigns for the right to repair.

## The e-waste problem

[E-waste](https://www.genevaenvironmentnetwork.org/resources/updates/the-growing-environmental-risks-of-e-waste/) is defined as used electronic devices with batteries or plugs that are at the end of their useful life. This includes devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets. It is estimated that humans generate over 50 million tons of e-waste per year, only a small proportion of which is recycled. Much of this waste ends up in developing countries, where it poses an environmental and health hazard.

### Preventing e-waste

The main thing you can do to prevent e-waste is to avoid upgrading unnecessarily and hold onto your devices for as long as possible. If a device is no longer needed, consider selling or donating it, or if it can no longer be used then take it to a recycling facility or return it to the manufacturer.

This Black Friday, please consider the environment and maybe **don’t** buy that new device.
