Back in May I had the privilege of speaking at [Beyond Tellerand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/), an incredible conference in Düsseldorf, Germany, with content extending way beyond web design into the realms of animation, mural painting, typography, digital art, Japanese calligraphy and more!

My own talk was on CSS layout, including some of the exciting new features we have at our disposal. If you want to get up to speed on what’s new in CSS layout, this is a good place to start.
