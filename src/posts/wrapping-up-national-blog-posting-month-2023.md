intro: 'Day 30 of National Blog Posting Month #NaBloPoMo'
---

We made it! I tasked myself with writing 30 posts in 30 days for National Blog Posting Month, and somehow I just about managed it (well, including this post — yes, I cheated!). So, what have I learned?

## Let yourself off the hook

Paradoxically, giving myself an off-ramp right at the beginning made me push myself harder. In the first post I had already set myself up with reasons (excuses) why I might not complete the task of posting every day for a month. I let myself feel comfortable with the idea that **trying** was the main thing, and that I wasn’t competing with anyone. Somehow that made me even more determined not to miss a day. I’m at my best when I’m only competing with myself.

## Anything can spark an idea

That’s not to say it wasn’t hard at times. There were days when I definitely struggled to think of a topic worthy of posting about, or to put my ideas into words. But, as I wrote on [day 23](https://css-irl.info/what-to-blog-about-when-you-dont-know-what-to-blog-about/), a blog topic can be just about **anything**. I kept a list of interesting things I’d read or seen, and dipped into those on days when I wasn’t feeling very original.

I also gave myself permission to keep posts short and sweet, some of them more like journal entries with half-formed ideas. I created a new category for demos on my blog, which helps me feel more comfortable with the idea of posting a quick demo with minimal explanation. Previously I often felt the pressure to accompany those kind of code experiments with a full tutorial.

## Writing helps with thinking

I’ve always got a lot out of the process of writing, but this is the first time I’ve really paid attention to how writing helps with the thinking process, sparking a chain of thoughts and ideas. Quite often I’d start a post thinking I would just write a few lines, but it ended up being much longer and the act of writing kicked off the thought process and helped clarify ideas.

## No room for perfection

If I waited until all my posts were perfect before I published them, I’d never publish **anything**. It’s OK to make mistakes and go back and correct yourself later, or extend and add to posts. (It’s also fine to leave them well alone!) But publishing every day for a month meant I absolutely did **not** have time to let my perfectionist tendencies take over. Sometimes I had to grit my teeth and resign myself to publishing something that I knew wasn’t as polished as it could have been. This was one of the hardest parts.

## Write for yourself

I love it when my writing benefits others, but first and foremost I write for myself. The process of writing helps embed coding tips and techniques and gives me a chance to explore new APIs and specifications outside of a work context, which gives me freedom to play and discover. And this blog provides me with a lasting trove of reference material from my past self that I can’t get any other way.

I haven’t been sharing many of these posts on social media, partly because I don’t want to spam people, and partly because many of them **do** feel like journal entries. I’m not sure if anyone would want to read them, and I’ve been mansplained a few too many times recently, which I don’t really have the energy to deal with. But writing without the pressure to share on social media and chase engagement has been quite freeing. It reminds me why I do it.

The discipline required to write every day for a month has helped me build a writing habit, and while I don’t plan to continue with it every day going forward, I do hope I’ll publish more regularly.

## That’s a wrap
