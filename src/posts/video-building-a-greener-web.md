It’s been great to see digital sustainability become more of a mainstream topic in recent months. With most of Europe baking in a deadly heatwave with unprecedated temperature, the need for action on climate change is more pressing than ever. If you’re not sure what action you, as a developer, can take, my talk from [All Day Hey](https://heypresents.com/conferences/2023) conference provides some facts, figures and starting points for thinking about sustainability in the context of web development.

Although it may seem like a big, scary topic, there’s a lot we can do in terms of mitigating environmental harm in our own work, sharing knowledge and influencing the industry as a whole. I hope you’ll find some useful takeaways here, and be encouraged to join the fight against climate change.
