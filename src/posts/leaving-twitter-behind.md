intro: 'Day 6 of National Blog Posting Month #NaBloPoMo'

It’s been a year since Twitter (X) went down the pan, and I finally got around to removing the Twitter link from this site. I haven’t visited the platform in months, except periodically, guiltily checking that I haven’t missed an important DM. I never post there, and the occasional fleeting glimpse of my feed is enough to convince me I’m not missing much.

I think it’s pretty safe to say I’m not going back. The only reason I haven’t deleted my two accounts on there is because there are a bunch of places on the web that link to my Twitter profiles, and I don’t want someone else taking my username and causing confusion. Nor do I like the idea of leaving dead links out there in the wild, going nowhere.

I post on [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@michelle) semi-regularly, but overall I’ve cut down my social media use quite a bit, which I think is a good thing. Overall, what I’ve gained outweighs what I’ve lost.

Even posting on Mastodon sometimes I find it overwhelming to try and keep up with the replies, and the cognitive load of trying to have constructive discussions on there. I’m trying to share a bit more on LinkedIn, which seems wise from a career perspective. But quite often now I’ll post on this blog without sharing it anywhere. It’s my own cosy little corner of the web.

I’m grateful for the connections I made on Twitter. But I’m ready to stop chasing likes.
