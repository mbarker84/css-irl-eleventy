I’m sure I’m not alone in noticing the recent proliferation of articles lamenting the impending (or, indeed, already happening) destruction of the web as we know it, due in large part to the influx of AI-generated content. For the most part, I share their pessimism. It’s hard not to see the devaluation of human content as anything but a negative.

But in the face of all this gloom, I think it’s important to define not just what we **don’t** want from the web, but what we **do**. I put some of these thoughts into words and created a manifesto for what _I_ think is a better vision for the web. It’s a lot of stuff that many of us care about greatly anyway, and are trying to put into practice daily. To me, it’s nice to have a place I can visit to remind myself of what’s important, why we do what we do, and how we can strive for a better web. It’s something of a work in progress — a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) if you will, which I expect to change over time. It comes from a place of hope.
