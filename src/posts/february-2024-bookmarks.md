I was just collating all the articles I’ve read over the past month in order to post them here when, coincidentally, Matthias Ott’s latest [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb) newsletter lands in my inbox! This month it’s all about bookmarks: how you collate them, where you keep them, and how you share them. I definitely need a better way to organise mine, which is why I’m sharing them here.

Here’s a bunch of stuff I’ve found interesting this month:
