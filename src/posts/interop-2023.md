Last year, [Interop 2022](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022), a collaborative cross-browser initiative, was hugely successful in getting 15 key features implemented interoperably. As developers, we can enjoy the fruits of this collaboration, with features like [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), [cascade layers](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/) and [dynamic viewport units](https://web.dev/viewport-units/) going from little or no browser support to almost full support in the space of a year.

[Interop 2023](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023) has just been announced, expanding to 26 focus areas. Some exciting CSS features include the [`:has()` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has), which is already supported in some browsers, as well as [Level 4 media queries](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-4/), [math functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions#math_functions), and [font palette features](https://webkit.org/blog/12662/customizing-color-fonts-on-the-web/), which enable custom coloured fonts.
