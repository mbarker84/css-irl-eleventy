Melinda Seckington has just launched a brand new blog series, **Beyond the Spotlight**, where she’ll be talking to conference speakers about their talk process, preparation and delivery. Melinda is an accomplished speaker , writer and engineering manager, so I was honoured to be the [first speaker interviewed](https://www.seckington.com/beyond-the-spotlight-michelle-barker/).

It was interesting to reflect on my experience of speaking at conferences and consider what drew me into it. I’m looking forward to reading more in the series.
