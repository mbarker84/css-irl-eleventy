Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of [Toronto Web Performance Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Web-Performance-Group/) (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.

## Web Performance And The Planet

[Fershad Irani](https://twitter.com/fershad) spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article [analysing the COP26 website](https://fershad.com/writing/cop26-a-quick-sustainability-check/) helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on [website carbon budgets](https://css-tricks.com/reduce-your-websites-environmental-impact-with-a-carbon-budget/).

## Building a Greener Web

My own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.

## The Carbon Footprint of Images

[Jon A. Særetås](https://twitter.com/jonarnes) talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.

<aside>You might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/reducing-web-carbon-footprint-optimizing-social-media-embeds/">Smashing Magazine</a>. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!</aside>
