Earlier this year the BBC published a report on digital sustainability, [Does what you scroll burn coal? Mythbusting energy consumption on the web](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/articles/2025-01-sustainability-web-energy-consumption). The report seeks to address some of the ways our online activities consume energy but interestingly, is quite critical of some of the web sustainability guidelines that have been developed and published by the community.

What’s frustrating here is that the report’s authors have done little to reach out to members of the digital sustainability community, and don’t acknowledge the nuance and dialogue that is continually at work in this space.

The purpose of web sustainability guidelines (such as those published by [Wholegrain](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/guidelines/), or the [Sustainable Web Interest Group](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/)) is to help those working on the web design and build websites in a way that minimises their environmental impact. They are living, breathing documents. They are the product of collaboration, and are designed to evolve with the evidence, recognising that no one has the perfect model for measuring the results of adoption. When blanket criticism is levelled in this way it can have the effect of discouraging others to take measures to reduce the environmental impact of their websites, but **also** to get involved with the community and contribute.

Chris and Andy at Wholegrain Digital have published their own [response to the report](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/lets-talk-digital-sustainability/) that adds some context to the claims made.
