When you get an invite from Chris and Dave to appear on [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com) it’s hard to say no! Despite my longstanding fear of sounding like an idiot on the airwaves, I swallowed my nerves and joined them for an episode on web sustaibaility — althought we managed to delve into a few other topics too. Naturally, right afterwards I thought of a whole bunch of things I forgot to mention (hopefully I’ll get around to writing one or two follow-up blog posts!), but I was pleased to get the chance to talk about this important subject on such an esteemed podcast. I hope listeners will take away one or two things, and be inspired to do their own research.
