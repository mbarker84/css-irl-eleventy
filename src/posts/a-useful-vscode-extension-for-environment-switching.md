Do you find yourself needing to switch between development environments frequently? That's often the case for me. I work on a web app for wind turbine operators, and I regularly need to test my front end code with different databases.

My colleague recently alerted me to [.ENV Switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EcksDy.env-switcher), a VS Code extension that makes switching between different environments simple. Once installed, you need to create your different .env files (such as dev.env, release.env). Then you bring up a list of .env files to select from by clicking on a small button at the bottom of the window, and instantly switch to the desired environment. Nice!
