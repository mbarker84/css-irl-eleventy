It‚Äôs been a while since my last article on here (well, a month is a while for me, anyway üòÖ), as I‚Äôve been busy with my head down preparing for my talk on modern CSS layout at [Beyond Tellerand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2023), which is (**checks notes**) tomorrow!

Although I haven‚Äôt had much time for blogging, it has given me a chance to delve once again into messaging about with CSS layout and the `:has()` pseudo-class, or ‚Äúparent selector‚Äù. I‚Äôve already written about `:has()` in a [previous post](https://css-irl.info/animated-grid-tracks-with-has/), and you can read an in-depth guide by Jen Simmons on [the Webkit blog](https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/). But to recap, `:has()` allows us to select a parent or sibling of an element by taking a relative selector list as its argument (to paraphrase [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)).

But what I‚Äôm realising as I continue to play around with `:has()` is that in practice, we can select **any** element in the DOM relative to another, as long as they share a common ancestor ‚Äî which they should, right? As any element that we want to select is going to have the `<body>` as its ancestor. This makes it pretty powerful.

So here a couple of demos to that effect. (You‚Äôll need to view these in a browser that supports `:has()`, e.g. Chrome or Safari.) In this one, hovering on a list item on the left animates our grid tracks on the right. They share a common wrapper element as their ancestor, but they don‚Äôt necessarily have to.

In this second demo, we‚Äôre adding a background colour to the `<section>` element targeted by a link in another `<section>` on hover or click. This is perhaps a bit of a silly demo, but I can see some potential use cases, such as providing a visual clue for users as to the targeted section of a document.

Lastly, this demo (best viewed on desktop) opens a panel (using animated grid tracks) when the user clicks the link on the left. The link‚Äôs target is hidden within the collapsed panel. (It also combines container queries for the content on the right.) Hiding and revealing content is often something that should be done with JS, and there are likely some accessibility issues here ‚Äî I‚Äôm not suggesting you should do anything like this in production. But it‚Äôs interesting to see the power of CSS today!
